## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

The following libraries were used in the project
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Seaborn

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, i was interested in exploring the data science salaries dataset which can be found [here on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries) to answer the following questions:

* How has the average salary of data science jobs change over time?
* What are the salaries of Data Science jobs based on experience level?
* Do Data scientist who work full time earn more than others?
* Does working in a larger company guarantee higher salary?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is only one notebook (Data Science Jobs Salaries) in this project which is used to carry out the exploratory analysis of the dataset. 

The project also includes this README file which explains the motivations for the project, installation guides, file descriptions conclusions as well as acknowledgements.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@tayos133/four-4-things-you-need-to-know-about-data-science-jobs-salaries-42e61454f520).
